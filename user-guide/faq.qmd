Below are the answers to some of the more frequently asked questions in the extendr community. 

## How do I rename my package?

When you change the name of your package in the `DESCRIPTION` file or `Cargo.toml` file, you will likely notice that your package fails to build. 

#### Problem

The package name is used in the building and linking steps. The package is expecting the old name, not the new one. 

#### Solution

Run `rextendr::use_extendr()` to regenerate the `Makevars.in`, `Makevars.win.in`, `entrypoint.c`, and `Cargo.toml` files.

## `Cargo.toml`
`use_extendr()` will overwrite your existing `Cargo.toml` file. Please copy or backup your dependencies or any other changes beforehand.
